# SafeSpeak

SafeSpeak is a real-time hate speech and offensive content detection system designed to help social media platforms and online communities maintain a safer digital environment. It uses machine learning and explainable AI techniques to identify harmful content while allowing flexible moderation rules.

## Problem Statement

Online hate speech and offensive content negatively impact mental health, social harmony, and platform trust. Existing reporting and moderation tools are often reactive, slow, or lack transparency.

SafeSpeak addresses this by providing:
- Real-time detection
- Explainable classification results
- Customizable moderation definitions

## Key Features

- **Hate Speech Detection**  
  Identifies hate speech and offensive language in user-generated text.

- **Real-Time Processing**  
  Flags content instantly as it is posted or streamed.

- **Explainable AI (XAI)**  
  Provides reasoning for why content is classified as hate speech.

- **Customizable Definitions**  
  Moderation rules can be adapted for different communities and platforms.

- **Multilingual Support**  
  Supports detection across multiple languages.

- **User Feedback Loop**  
  Allows feedback to improve detection accuracy over time.

- **Easy Integration**  
  Designed to be integrated as a plugin or API with existing systems.

## Target Users

- Social media platforms  
- Content moderation teams  
- Parents and guardians  
- Online communities and forums

## Tech Stack (Indicative)

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Machine Learning:** NLP-based classification models  
- **Backend:** REST-based service (API-driven)  
- **Frontend / Plugin:** Web-based interface or browser/plugin integration  
- **Database:** For logs, feedback, and moderation records  

> Note: The implementation focuses on functionality and concept demonstration rather than production-scale deployment.

## How It Works

1. User-generated text is passed to the SafeSpeak system.
2. The ML model analyzes the content for hate speech patterns.
3. The system classifies the content and generates an explanation.
4. Based on platform rules, the content is flagged, filtered, or allowed.
5. Feedback can be collected to improve future predictions.

## Business Model

SafeSpeak is designed as a **subscription-based B2B solution**, allowing platforms to integrate hate speech detection into their systems at scale.
